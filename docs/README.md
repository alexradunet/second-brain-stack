# Second Brain — AI-Assisted Personal Knowledge Management

A personal knowledge management system built on Obsidian, powered by an AI agent (Nazar) running OpenClaw, synchronized across devices via Git, and hosted on a hardened Debian VPS behind Tailscale.

## Clone and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/second-brain.git
cd second-brain
```

1. Open `vault/` in Obsidian — the PARA folder structure is ready to use
2. Customize the agent personality in `vault/99-system/openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md`
3. Fill in your details in `vault/99-system/openclaw/workspace/USER.md`
4. Deploy to a VPS when ready (see [Deployment Guide](deployment.md))

## What Is This?

Three things working together:

1. **An Obsidian vault** (`vault/`) — organized with the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) plus Inbox and Daily Journey
2. **An AI agent** (Nazar) — lives inside the vault, processes voice messages, manages your daily journal, and answers questions about your life
3. **A deployment stack** (`deploy/`) — Docker containers that run the agent and sync the vault across all your devices

## Quick Start

### Local only (no VPS)

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `vault/` in Obsidian
3. Start writing notes — the PARA folder structure is ready
4. Templates are in `99-system/templates/`

### With VPS deployment

1. Spin up a Debian 13 VPS
2. SSH in as root, install Claude Code
4. Point Claude Code at the `vps-setup` skill:
   ```
   Read vault/99-system/openclaw/skills/vps-setup/SKILL.md and help me set up this VPS
   ```
5. Or run the one-liner:
   ```bash
   sudo bash provision-vps.sh --deploy-repo /srv/nazar/deploy
   ```

See [Deployment Guide](deployment.md) for the full walkthrough.
